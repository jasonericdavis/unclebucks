      Uncle Buck’s is a non-profit organization that was Birthed out of the loss of a wonderful father, pastor, and friend Uncle Buck’s provides restoration to young men across the greater Atlanta area.

    After the loss of his father, Rev. Curlee “Uncle Buck” Windham, Sr., Todd Windham turned their bonding time into a service for young men, restoring quality shoes for quality men.  
    <br/>
    Todd began going to local thrift stores and searching for hidden gems in the men’s shoe department and would then spend hours restoring the luster and shine of each shoe. Once the shoes meet the Uncle Buck standard, they are donated to young men in need of quality dress shoes.

This organization aims to restore the presence of a well-dressed black man. To teach boys and young men the importance of knowing how to tie a tie, how to match your shoes with your belt and the simplicity of a lovely pocket square. To restore the confidence and image of a refined black man.  
  
The purpose of Uncle Buck’s is to honor the first well-dressed man in the life of our founder, his father. Each shoe is given the same attention Buck gave to Todd as they shined shoes together in his youth. Still using the same shine box and tools, Uncle Buck’s wants to help young men put their best foot forward.
